# No-Deal
A 3D First Person Shooter game template in the 1.9.10 version of LibGDX for Java 8.

## Description
<p>No Deal was an attempt to develop a simple first person shooter game I carried out as a final academic project for my technical high scool, in the year 2020.
Unfortunately, the project couldn't end as I wanted, but I think I got a really good basic template to everyone who want to create a Java 3D First Person game.<br><br>
  <bold>IMPORTANT ADVICE:</bold> The menues of the game and some commentary lines in the code are fully writed on Spanish, but fortunately all the code is writen in English.</p>

## What I couldn't do
Between the things that I couldn't add to the projects are:
  - The networking.
  - The directional sound.
  - The player's model.
  - The timer.
  - The scoreboard.
  - The skyboxes.
  - The raycasting shoots decals.
  - The settings options saving.
  - The team selection menues.
  - The gun dropping and picking system.


## What I did
The most important things I've made for the project are:
  - A basic player movement and mouse looking mechanism.
  - The essentials physics for walking, running and jumping.
  - A raycasting shooting mechanism including the desviations for jumping or moving when shooting the gun.
  - A versatile and simple 3D Models importing for all the project entities, including the textures and animations.
  - A main menu music player with all its needed user controls to improve the user experience.
  - A bot spawning and player chasing system.
  - An entity system to create character, guns, maps, props and any other interactive object in the game.
  - A basic set of menues, including settings, credits and pause.
  - A fully functional HUD.

## How I did it?
<p>I based my project on the "Building a 3D Game with LibGDX" book by Sebastian Di Giussepe, but I needed to make some changes to make that works in this LibGDX version, like use the Y axis to the gravity instead of the Z axis, and some other changes to make fix the errors and complete the book tutorial, like making my own HUD system instead of the described on the book.</p>

## Want to help me?
You can give the project a star, or simply share this to anyone you know is working on a Java 3D Game Project.
