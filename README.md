# No-Deal
A 3D First Person Shooter game in LibGDX for Java 8.


No Deal was an attempt to develop a simple first person shooter game I carried out as a final academic project for my technical high scool, in the year 2020.
Unfortunely, the project couldn't end as I wanted, but I think I got a really good basic template to everyone who want to create a Java 3D First Person game.

Between the things that I couldn't add to the projects are:
  - The networking.
  - The directional sound.
  - The player's model.
  - The timer.
  - The scoreboard.
  - The skyboxes.
  - The raycasting shoots decals.
  - The settings options saving.
  - The team selection menues.
  - The gun dropping and picking system.
